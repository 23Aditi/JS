# JavaScript Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey of learning JavaScript. JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language that is essential for building dynamic, interactive websites. It's widely used for both client-side and server-side development and plays a central role in web development.

Through this repository, Iâ€™ll be exploring core concepts, modern JavaScript features (like ES6+), and building small projects to strengthen my skills. This will also include coding challenges and solutions to further enhance my problem-solving abilities.

Stay tuned as I document my progress and share useful resources, tips, and insights I gather along the way!
